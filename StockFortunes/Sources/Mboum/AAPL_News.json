A federal judge on Friday denied the Alphabet Inc. unit\u2019s initial request to throw out the case.\u201cThe court concludes that Google did not notify users that Google engages in the alleged data collection while the user is in private browsing mode,\u201d U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, wrote in her ruling.The ruling comes as Google and Apple Inc. face intense scrutiny by lawmakers over their data gathering practices. Google has said it will next year eliminate third-party cookies that help advertisers keep tabs on consumers\u2019 web activity and won\u2019t employ alternative methods to track individuals.Read more: Google Sued for Secretly Amassing Vast Trove of User DataThree Google users filed a complaint in June claiming the company carries on a \u201cpervasive data tracking business.\u201d Google collects browsing history and other web activity data even after users employ safeguards to protect their data such as using \u201cIncognito\u201d private browsing mode, according to the complaint.\u201cGoogle knows who your friends are, what your hobbies are, what you like to eat, what movies you watch, where and when you like to shop, what your favorite vacation destinations are, what your favorite color is, and even the most intimate and potentially embarrassing things you browse on the internet -- regardless of whether you follow Google\u2019s advice to keep your activities \u2018private,\u2019\u201d according to the complaint.Google argued the plaintiffs consented to its privacy policy, which the company said explicitly discloses its data collection practices.\u201cGoogle also makes clear that \u2018Incognito\u2019 does not mean \u2018invisible,\u2019 and that the user\u2019s activity during that session may be visible to websites they visit, and any third-party analytics or ads services the visited websites use,\u201d Google said in a court filing.Google had no immediate comment on the ruling.The case is Brown v.
