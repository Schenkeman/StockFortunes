            "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The chief executives of Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Twitter Inc. are set to testify in Washington next month as Congress gears up for a new round of scrutiny of giant technology companies.Two separate House committees on Thursday announced plans to examine the power of the major tech platforms. The three executives will testify in March, while a House antitrust panel announced hearings to consider legislation that could curb the companies\u2019 dominance.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey will appear virtually at a March 25 hearing before a House Energy and Commerce joint subcommittee hearing on online misinformation and disinformation.The hearings by the House antitrust panel, which are slated to start next week, stem from a 16-month investigation of the tech industry that determined companies like Google and Amazon.com Inc. are using their power to thwart competition in digital markets.\u201cFor too long, the dominance of a handful of gatekeepers online has wreaked havoc on competition, suppressed innovation, and weakened entrepreneurship,\u201d Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, who chairs the panel, said in a statement. \u201cI pledged to undertake a series of legislative reforms to restore competition online and to strengthen the antitrust laws. I look forward to working on a bipartisan basis to do just that.\u201dThe hearings will kick off Thursday and focus on addressing gatekeeper power and lowering barriers to competition online, according to the committee. Additional hearings will look at modernizing antitrust laws used to police mergers and anticompetitve conduct.A committee spokeswoman said a list of witnesses wasn\u2019t yet available.The House move to examine potential changes to antitrust laws comes as Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota introduced legislation in the Senate to target large mergers and dominant companies.Zuckerberg and Dorsey testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in November about content moderation and their role in political discourse.At that hearing, the chief executives were hit with Republican complaints that the companies silence conservatives, while Democrats expressed worries about the proliferation of misinformation and hate speech on the platforms. The companies have consistently denied any bias against conservatives or their viewpoints.The CEOs did say that companies should be more transparent about what kinds of posts they remove. Zuckerberg suggested that tech companies should have to meet certain standards for removing content as part of any changes to regulation.Zuckerberg and Pichai also testified before Cicilline\u2019s panel last July, along with Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook of Apple Inc., during a five-hour hearing into their market power.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.",

India launched a $6.7 billion plan to boost smartphone exports last year as a part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s initiative towards promoting electronics manufacturing and job creation. The Indian government will be introducing incentives to drive local manufacturing of IT products, including tablets, laptops, and servers. India could offer cash-back to export manufacturers with a budget of up to $964.5 million (Rs 70 billion) over five years under its novel performance-linked incentive PLI scheme. Apple and others are pushing for a higher budgetary outlay of $2.75 billion (Rs 200 billion) before that plan is finalized, as India lacks the scale and supply chain for making IT products. New Delhi is contemplating another PLI budget of $688.5 million (Rs 50 billion) over five years to boost domestic manufacturing of wearable devices like smartwatches. The tech giant had ramped up the production of iPhones in India to reduce dependence on China amidst Donald Trump\u2019s trade war against the country. Apple had outsourced the production of iPads to Vietnam and India to mitigate the impact of the trade war and the pandemic. Apple will likely have iPad\u2019s assembled by one of its existing suppliers in India as early as this year which might get delayed amidst entry restrictions for Apple\u2019s Chinese supplier BYD Electronic (International) Co Ltd (OTC: BYDIF). That leaves Apple with Foxconn Technology Co Ltd (OTC: FXCOF), Wistron Corp (OTC: WICOF), Pegatron Corp (OTC: PGTRF), and Compal Electronics Inc (OTC: CMPCY) for India. iPhone supplier Wistron has resumed operations at a southern Indian plant after a protest from angry workers last year. Apple is yet to take the Taiwan manufacturer off the trial. Apple\u2019s three suppliers have committed $900 million over five years towards iPhone production in India. Price action: AAPL shares were down 1.75% at $128.55 on the last check Thursday.

According to the Reuters report, the Indian government is working on a plan to offer a new performance-linked incentive scheme to drive local manufacturing of IT products including tablets, servers, and laptops. Apple (AAPL) is lobbying for a higher budget outlay of 200 billion rupees before the new incentive plan is finalized, Reuters said. The new performance-linked incentive scheme will have a budget of up to $964.5 million over five years and will offer cash-back to manufacturers for exports. This scheme is expected to be launched by the end of this month. Apple has been steadily increasing its production of iPhones in India to reduce the company\u2019s dependence on Chinese manufacturers, according to Reuters. Last year, India had launched a plan worth $6.7 billion to boost smartphone exports and Apple had participated in the scheme through its contract manufacturers, the report said. Meanwhile, Apple\u2019s most recent 1Q earnings saw its largest revenues in a single quarter, exceeding the $100 billion milestone for the first time, driven by strong sales in every product category, especially 5G iPhone sales. The company\u2019s iPad revenues soared 41% to $8.44 billion year-over-year and exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates of $7.46 billion. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks) On Feb. 16, Raymond James analyst Chris Caso reiterated a Buy rating on the stock. Caso stated, \u201c\u2026our analysis demonstrates that iPhone units have run a cumulative 55 million units below a 215 million unit trendline in FY19 and FY20, thereby creating an opportunity for mean reversion as the installed base ages.\u201d \u201cAnd we see a reason for that installed base to upgrade, with better global 5G penetration later this year, and improved phone features, such as the return of fingerprint sensing. Net, if we assume that mean reversion allows a return to a prior peak iPhone unit number of 231 million units at current ASPs [average selling price], that would drive FY22 iPhone revenue over $200 billion, or 10% in excess of current expectations,\u201d Caso added. The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That\u2019s based on 19 analysts recommending a Buy, 5 analysts suggesting a Hold, and 2 analysts recommending a Sell. The average analyst price target of $149.70 implies 14.4% upside potential to current levels.

            "description": "It\u2019s been a tough week for some of the world\u2019s largest stocks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) keep losing ground (see more below), and now Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) joins them as investors register disappointment with the company\u2019s earnings and outlook. Shares fell 5% in pre-market trading after WMT missed Wall Street\u2019s earnings per share projection and forecast tepid fiscal 2022 growth. There was a lot to like about WMT\u2019s quarter, including sales that surpassed expectations and rose 7.3% from a year ago to top $152 billion. Analysts had expected around $148 billion. U.S. same-store sales did even better, and U.S. e-commerce sales rolled up 69% gains. However, the company\u2019s $1.39 a share in earnings came up 12 cents short of the Wall Street average $1.51 estimate, hurt by WMT\u2019s decision to repay property tax relief in the U.K. that cost it 7 cents a share on the bottom line. WMT\u2019s investment in supply chain and automation will probably be under a microscope the rest of year to see if investment panned out to continued growth. Digital advertising, health care, and web marketplaces are higher margin businesses than WMT\u2019s core business. They will be spending more on investment, and that will go toward trying to help the digital side of their business. Consider listening on the conference call to monitor for details on how profitable the e-commerce business has been because it actually doesn\u2019t make money yet. A big piece of the dip in WMT shares this morning was its outlook. WMT sees FY 2022 sales rising in the low single digits, with operating income and earnings flat to up slightly. WMT shares are up nearly 24% over the last year, ahead of the S&P 500 Index (SPX). This morning, at least, it looks like investors are dialing some of that back as they contemplate what looks like a pretty sluggish earnings picture ahead. One other interesting note before we leave the WMT discussion: The company said it plans to raise its U.S. associate wages to an average of above $15 an hour. This could influence the debate around the minimum wage in Washington, where some in Congress want to raise the national minimum to $15 as part of the fiscal stimulus bill. We\u2019ll see if those who want to raise it start to cite WMT\u2019s move in their talking points. Washington View: GameStop Hearing Up Next After WMT, attention today could veer toward Capitol Hill, where a hearing on the GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) stock controversy from last month will feature testimony from company leaders and investors involved in January\u2019s stock market volatility. This is likely to be watched by the entire industry, from businesses to individual investors, and media reports say participants likely will face grilling from both sides of the aisle. Other things on the calendar include import and export prices, which could be interesting, and this morning\u2019s weekly initial jobless claims number. If people were hoping for some solace there after the disappointing WMT news, they didn\u2019t find any. New claims rose to 861,000 in the latest week. That was way above the Wall Street consensus for 775,000, and up from an upwardly revised 848,000 the prior week. Stock index futures\u2014already under pressure from WMT\u2014extended losses after the jobless claims data. Speaking of which, when you look at next week\u2019s initial claims, they may appear lower than expected because it\u2019s doubtful many people were able to file in Texas with the weather there this week. So a positive reading next Thursday might not tell the whole story. Looking back at yesterday, the market basically pulled a pretty big head fake, recovering from early losses. It shows that it doesn\u2019t make sense to panic when you see the market pull back, and instead you might chalk up sudden moves to the continued choppy pattern we\u2019ve been witnessing. Part of this week\u2019s choppiness reflects that there\u2019s a lot of economic data and earnings to digest, and Wednesday was particularly heavy with retail sales, producer prices, and Fed minutes. There\u2019s also continued progress on the stimulus package, which is helping raise yields in the bond market. Another thing to keep an eye on is the power outage situation in Texas. If it\u2019s a short-term thing, the effect probably will be minimal. But if it continues, there could be a lasting impact on businesses, like you often see with hurricanes. Sometimes these types of weather events can hurt retail sales and even take a bite out of quarterly gross domestic product, though it\u2019s too early to say if that\u2019s going to happen. Yield Surge Clips Tech Market The Info Tech sector posted the worst results of all S&P 500 sectors yesterday, plagued in part by rising Treasury yields. Strong readings on January retail sales and the producer price index released early Wednesday gave the yield rally another lift, and higher rates are often considered a weight on Tech and other growth stocks. Remember back in late 2018 how the Tech market took a pounding after yields reached multi-year highs. We\u2019re nowhere near those levels now, which topped 3% for the 10-year Treasury yield back then. The current yield near 1.29%\u2014down a few ticks this morning after the weak claims data\u2014would have been an all-time low before last year, but it\u2019s the momentum of its climb that may be causing worries for growth stock investors. It\u2019s gone up around 40 basis points since the start of this year, a pace you don\u2019t often see in this particular market. One way to look at that could be that there\u2019s never been a time quite like this, with the economy emerging from a self-induced (well, pandemic-induced) recession. It wasn\u2019t a normal recession where demand began to flag or the financial markets got out of whack. Instead, we brought it on ourselves by shutting down the world economy. That, followed by central banks around the world immediately dropping rates to zero and scooping up bonds to push yields down, caused the record low interest rates. Now if the pandemic truly is starting to retreat, it\u2019s hard to find natural reasons for rates to be this low (aside from the fact that unemployment remains a major problem in the wake of the recession and may not be able to claw back as quickly as the overall economy). On the other hand, the Fed has said it has no plans to stop its $120 billion a month bond purchase program anytime soon, and forecasts the next rate rise not in terms of months, but years. This could ultimately put a brake on the yield rally, but we\u2019ll have to wait and see. Gold Keeps Struggling Despite Inflation Concerns Let\u2019s go from stocks that trade for pennies to a commodity that commands over $1,700 for just an ounce. We\u2019ve talked about the \u201crisk-on\u201d mood playing a bigger role lately, something you can see in the relatively weak dollar (which continues to scratch along near three-year lows), and falling bond values. Another possible sign of this could be what\u2019s going on in the gold market. Gold has fallen four days in a row, and on Wednesday it carved a \u201cdeath cross\u201d on the charts (see chart below). That\u2019s where the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average, and analysts say it can often point to more weakness ahead. It\u2019s a little bit odd to see gold taking a dive right even while the U.S. Congress looks like it\u2019s getting closer to passing a huge stimulus bill that some analysts worry could drive up inflation. You\u2019d think that with inflation becoming more of a concern (also possibly evident in the recent rise of Treasury yields), gold might be getting a bit more of an embrace from investors. Some analysts think that\u2019s not out of the question. That would be good news for people holding shares of mining companies like Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE: GOLD) and Newmont Corporation (NYSE: NEM), which have been in a slump lately. Still, it\u2019s been a rough few months for gold lovers who saw the precious metal rise above $2,000 an ounce last year for the first time. Gold recently traded at $1,772, down nearly $300 from last year\u2019s highs. CHART OF THE DAY: GOLD\u2019S \u201cDEATH CROSS.\u201d Gold (/GC\u2014candlestick) has been falling pretty steadily from its recent highs, and has now painted a \u201cdeath cross\u201d on the charts. That\u2019s when the 50-day moving average (blue line) falls below the 200-day moving average (red line). It\u2019s usually considered technically bearish. Data source: CME Group.

The market often resembled a game of follow-the-leader the last year or two, but two of its leaders appear to be missing in action. Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), which both split their stocks last summer and generated loads of enthusiasm among investors, are spinning their wheels so far this month. AAPL, which rose 10% in December and was flat in January, is down about 1.5% for February. TSLA rose 24% in December and 12% in January but is down 2.5% in February and back below $800 a share. Plenty of people will likely pin this on overbought conditions and profit taking, and they might have a point. It\u2019s almost certainly not a reaction to earnings from either company, both of which drew accolades for their recent results. One negative factor could be investor money moving in other directions. First of all, the reopening economy apparently is helping shares of Energy and Financial companies, along with smaller stocks that tend to do best when the U.S. economy improves. The Russell 2000 (RUT) small-cap index has been an early leader this year. Also, alternative investments like bitcoin have been a magnet for many investors, while rising bond yields may be drawing some people toward fixed income. Then things got tougher for AAPL on Wednesday with news that Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\u2019s (NYSE: BRK) Warren Buffett was selling some shares (though it remains a huge holder of AAPL). Whatever the reason, seeing AAPL and TSLA shares losing a little zip isn\u2019t necessarily good for the broader market, which often moves higher on their lead. Instead, their recent lack of leadership may be zapping investor enthusiasm beyond their immediate orbit, while their huge market-caps have an oversized impact on the path of the Nasdaq (COMP). \u201cOracle of Omaha\u201d Strikes Again: Since we brought up Buffet (above), it\u2019s worth noting that BRK\u2019s stock purchases announced Wednesday veered toward a couple of sectors that until recently hadn\u2019t received much love from investors: Energy and telecom. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZN) shares jumped 5% on news of BRK\u2019s move, while Chevron (CVX) climbed 3%. Energy (which got dramatically smacked down by Covid in 2020) has been on a roll lately as reopening optimism picks up, so it\u2019s not too surprising to see BRK taking a position in CVX. But VZN and its competitors T-Mobile Us Inc (NASDAQ: TMUS) and AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) haven\u2019t exactly been lighting up Wall Street with their performance lately. Maybe Buffett\u2014widely known as a \u201cvalue\u201d investor\u2014sees an opportunity in this run-down part of the market. A bit of a head-scratcher was BRK\u2019s decision to sell some bank shares, another value sector that\u2019s been gaining ground recently. Should investors follow Buffett\u2019s lead? Well, maybe they were ahead of him. The \u201cvalue\u201d segments of the broader market have been gaining vs. \u201cgrowth\u201d stocks lately, a trend we also saw for a couple of months last fall. Generally, however, Buffett\u2019s been right more often than he\u2019s been wrong over the years. Which is why they call him \u201cthe Oracle of Omaha,\u201d of course. On Short Squeezes and Hedgers: We saw what happened with GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC)\u2014two short-lived short squeezes that actually inflicted some real fear and pain among some hedge funds and other short sellers\u2014who learned first-hand how far a market can detach from fundamentals during a squeeze. But another apparent target\u2014a handful of silver-backed ETFs\u2014was met with a fresh wave of selling almost immediately after piling in. Why the difference? The silver market is a commodities market, and much of the so-called \u201cshort interest\u201d may be the very funds issuing these silver-backed ETFs, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS). In other words, the shorts are what commodities traders call a \u201ccommercial hedge.\u201d So no matter how high or low silver goes, the funds holding them have either minimized exposure or no exposure at all (if it\u2019s a 100% hedge). Plus, with the silver-backed ETF market worth only 900 million ounces in a larger 25 billion-ounce physical market, the funds are no more than a rounding error compared to the vast silver market. The lessons? Do your homework before you jump into any trade, even a follow-the-herd momentum trade. There may be no real safety in numbers. And not all short interest is subject to the same squeeze dynamics as a low-liquidity stock. TD Ameritrade\u00ae commentary for educational purposes only. Member SIPC.
